Sortieralgorithmen MT (WinForms)

This project is a simple application built using WinForms and the ScottPlot library. It allows you to visualize and compare the execution times of different sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. Additionally, you can input your own data or generate random arrays for testing.
Features

    Sorting Algorithms:
        Bubble Sort
        Quick Sort
        Insertion Sort
        Selection Sort
        .NET built-in Sort method
    Performance Measurement:
        Execution times are measured in nanoseconds using Stopwatch.
        A bar chart is generated using ScottPlot to display the average execution times of the algorithms.
    User Input:
        Manual input of arrays or random generation of values.
        Load arrays from text files.
    Test Mode:
        Automatically run sorting tests with a predefined number of random values.
